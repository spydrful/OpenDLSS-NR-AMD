/* MochizukiNrRuntime.dll's own C exports, beside LmxxfNrGetApi (LmxxfNrApi.h, which this header leaves untouched, so
 * the lmxxf runtime and hosts that know only that ABI are unaffected). A host resolves each export with
 * GetProcAddress; a missing one means an older runtime.
 *
 * Current OpenNR size contract: callers initialize struct_size. SetControls accepts a supplied byte prefix that
 * reaches offsetof(MochizukiNrControls, drs_mode), copies up to the current struct size, and defaults the missing
 * tail. GetInfo and GetControlDefaults require at least sizeof the current struct; shorter output structs are
 * rejected. They write the current struct and report its sizeof, including tail padding. This differs from the
 * original runtime's prefix-sized output and last-written-field convention. Consumers must use the current
 * declarations and must not infer support for appended fields from bytes that are currently padding. The layouts
 * and optional export names are retained for the pinned host; see game/README.md for telemetry limitations.
 *
 * LMXXF_NR_CREATE_FLAG_ZERO_OUTPUT_FALLBACK, for this runtime: when the network fails on a frame, the frame's
 * original colour is passed through to Super Resolution; the output is never zeros. */
